= Codename One MP3 Encoder

This library adds support for MP3 audio recording in the simulator.  This only affects the simulator/JavaSE port of https://www.codenameone.com[Codename One].

== Installation

Install the "CN1MP3Encoder" cn1lib via Codename One settings.

== Usage

The presence of this library affect the following two APIs in `com.codename1.media.MediaManager`:

1. `getAvailableRecordingMimeTypes()` - This should now include "audio/mp3" as one of the supported recording mimetypes.
2. `createMediaRecorder()` - This will now accept "audio/mp3" as the mimetype, and will encode the audio in MP3 format.
